"Wiki for phpWebSite":http://github.com/meisteg/wiki brings the power and convenience of a wiki to "phpWebSite":http://phpwebsite.appstate.edu. This minor bugfix release fixes extended character support to include more letters.  Also, the broken help links have been fixed. phpWebSite 1.6.0 or later is required.

The Wiki module can be "downloaded from GitHub":http://github.com/meisteg/wiki/downloads.

If you have any questions or comments about the Wiki module, "please submit a ticket":http://github.com/meisteg/wiki/issues on the project site.

Enjoy the new version!
